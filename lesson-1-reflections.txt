What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
		You define what the important changes are. You aren't overwhelmed with information.
	Cons
		You can lose valuable information if you don't save on time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programs are complex and often need access to multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    A git log is a document of all of the commits tied to a code. 
	By using this and git diff you can define exactly where the errors in coding happened.
	Git diff can compare different versions of the same file.
	Note: Default windows command for file comparing is FC for linux and maC is Diff
	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back
