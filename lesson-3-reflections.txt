When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    When wanting to ensure the safety of your data.
    When working on your project from multiple PCs.
    When collaborating with other users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have changes that are incomplete or that you don't want to include in the update altogether.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is a direct copy from one repository to another. You would want to use this when wanting to make changes to a code         without affecting the original.
    A fork is a clone that is done on the git hub servers. This allows for better tracking. 
    A branch is a node off of an existing version of code. It is used when you want to make revisions to code without changing the     main branch. In a sense, it is like a fork, but done locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
